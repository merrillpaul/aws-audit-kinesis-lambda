# Audit log processing with AWS Serverless with Kinesis streams



## Design

Audit events are placed into a Kinesis stream. Every insertion, triggers a `Î»` function which processes the payload and adds to a Elastisearch index.
This allows an admin to investigate these events using Kibana or any other tools that can interface with ELastisearch.


## Local Setup

This is primarily for emulating the AWS Elastisearch, Kinesis and Lambda locally before deploying to AWS.

### Elasticsearch

Install Elasticearch as documented in https://www.elastic.co/downloads. Once extracted, add the `bin` to path and test by running 
```sh
elasticsearch
```
OPen a browser and go to http://localhost:9200 to explore the options of elasticsearch

### Kibana


Install Kibana as documented in https://www.elastic.co/downloads. Once extracted, add the `bin` to path and test by running 
```sh
kibana
```
Open a browser and go to http://localhost:5601 to explore the UI

## Offline mode

Allow to run the system locally in offline mode.
`npm run offline`

This:
- Starts **Kinesis** using the kinesalite npm module to emulate kinesis
- Creates the required Kinesis stream for Audit log
- Starts a listener on to the above stream so as to invoke the handler
- Starts a demo http endpoint which can be used to test to insert an object into Kinesis


### Test Publish to Kinesis
```sh
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:3000/logEvent \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Postman-Token: 628ba423-db37-430c-8661-14f3a4bdfb9f' \
  -H 'User-Agent: Assess/Webview' \
  -d '{
